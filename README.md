* Easily create/customise/manage command line shortcuts.
* Never loose your shell aliases/easily share between devices. Save in your own repo (from <a href=https://github.com/ticaboo/kish >Template</a>)
* Never have to type cd, or its evil twin cd .. again!
* Zero dependencies. Simple to use test framework (KIT)
* Ubiqutous v3 portable pure shell script.
* Comes with very useful example scripts:
  * ocal : fast easy human cli for creating calendar events.
  * omap : open maps with location or directions



## Install
click Use this template button on  <a href=https://github.com/ticaboo/kish >this page</a>.
Then clone your repo and:
```
cd kish
npm i
npm run kiu
source ~/.zshrc # or restart terminal

ki
```

$> ki shows the help generated from your aliased commands.
$> kiu updates changes to your aliases. Note can run from anywhere.
$> kin runs a wizzard to create a new command.

Please Star the <a href="https://github.com/ki-sh/kishcore"> kishcore repo </a> to be alerted to
core shared updates. (This separation enables shared enhancements as well as your own source control over your own scripts/aliases.)


After first install, ki, kin, kiu can be run from anywhere, so you dont have to 
cd into kish. 

Congratulations, you are on the flowfull path of never using cd .. again!

Here is a video showing the features of ki, with an example of one way of using it
in a polyrepo scenario:



## saves you a ton of typing, ramps up flow:

| strokes saved | ShortTask | long equivalent                 |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| 2             | g         | git                             |
| 5             | ga        | git add .                       |
| 8             | gb        | git branch                      |
| 12            | gc        | git commit -m ''                |
| 29            | gca       | git commit -a --amend --no-edit |
| 11            | gco       | git checkout                    |
| 13            | gcob      | git checkout -b                 |
| 10            | gs        | git status -s -b                |
| 1             | h         | gh (github-cli)                 |
| 4             | pull      | git pull                        |
| 4             | push      | git push                        |
| 23            | pushnew   | git push --set-upstream origin  |
| 6             | n         | npm run                         |
| 7             | pn        | pnpm run                        |
| 2             | y         | yarn                            |

- Quick setup / update.
- Easy to configure / adapt / make your own.
- Singe / multiple targets simultaneously.
- No dependencies. - pure shell scripts.
- Useful for any language, version control, packaging system.

But its more than just about saving keystrokes. The long commands cause mental impedence. Let alone cd/cd ../..etc. You will quickly find what were chores before become second nature flow. And flow matters. 

ki powered commands work thus:
ki anycommand anydirectores anyfiles anything_else_are_args_to_the_command.
ki visits into the directories given, runs the command and comes back out. Simple really. Why did we never have this before?!
The order of files args commands does not matter.

Cli designed especially for mono/hybrid/poly repos. 

## Roadmap

Coming soon - filter to vscode workspaces.
